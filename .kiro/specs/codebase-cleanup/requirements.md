# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves cleaning up the existing social impact platform codebase by removing non-essential files, consolidating functionality, and maintaining only the core features needed for a minimal viable product. The goal is to simplify the codebase while preserving essential functionality for social media task completion and USDC rewards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and minimal codebase, so that I can easily understand, maintain, and extend the core functionality without unnecessary complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the project structure THEN the system SHALL contain only essential files for core functionality
2. WHEN examining API routes THEN the system SHALL maintain only the minimum required endpoints for user authentication, job management, and wallet operations
3. WHEN checking components THEN the system SHALL keep only UI components that are actively used in the core user flows
4. WHEN looking at documentation THEN the system SHALL retain only relevant setup and usage documentation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all core functionality to remain intact after cleanup, so that I can still complete social media tasks and earn USDC rewards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the platform THEN the system SHALL maintain user authentication via Twitter OAuth
2. WHEN browsing jobs THEN the system SHALL display available social media engagement tasks
3. WHEN completing tasks THEN the system SHALL verify Twitter actions and distribute USDC rewards
4. WHEN managing wallet THEN the system SHALL allow balance checking and withdrawal functionality
5. WHEN creating jobs THEN the system SHALL enable job creation with USDC deposits

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to remain functional after cleanup, so that the application can still be deployed and run successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running npm install THEN the system SHALL install only necessary dependencies
2. WHEN executing npm run dev THEN the system SHALL start the development server without errors
3. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL compile successfully with no missing dependencies
4. WHEN deploying to Vercel THEN the system SHALL deploy without configuration issues

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want clear documentation of what was removed, so that I can understand the cleanup decisions and restore functionality if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of removed files and directories
2. WHEN reviewing changes THEN the system SHALL document which features were consolidated or removed
3. WHEN checking dependencies THEN the system SHALL list any packages that were removed from package.json
4. WHEN examining the codebase THEN the system SHALL maintain comments explaining any significant structural changes
