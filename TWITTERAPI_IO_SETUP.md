# TwitterAPI.io Verification Setup

## Overview
This application now uses **TwitterAPI.io** as the single, reliable verification method for Twitter actions (likes, retweets, replies).

## What is TwitterAPI.io?
TwitterAPI.io is a professional Twitter API service that provides:
- ✅ **Reliable Access** - Professional-grade Twitter API access
- ✅ **Real-time Data** - Up-to-date user statistics and metrics
- ✅ **High Rate Limits** - Suitable for production applications
- ✅ **Simple Integration** - Easy-to-use REST API
- ✅ **Accurate Verification** - Precise count tracking for verification

## Configuration

### Environment Variables Required
Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
TWITTERAPI_IO_USER_ID=344176544479072260
TWITTERAPI_IO_API_KEY=e8191bd0956349cc9bd70c8c065e0183
```

### For Vercel Deployment
Set these environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:
- `TWITTERAPI_IO_USER_ID` = `344176544479072260`
- `TWITTERAPI_IO_API_KEY` = `e8191bd0956349cc9bd70c8c065e0183`

See `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed deployment instructions.

## How It Works

### Verification Process
1. **Initialize**: Capture user's current Twitter statistics (tweets, likes, etc.)
2. **User Action**: User completes the required Twitter action (like, retweet, reply)
3. **Verify**: Re-fetch user statistics and compare the difference
4. **Result**: Success if the appropriate count increased by 1 (or more)

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /v1/users/by/username/{username}` - Get user profile and public metrics

### Data Retrieved
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "user_id",
    "username": "username",
    "public_metrics": {
      "tweet_count": 1234,
      "like_count": 5678,
      "following_count": 100,
      "followers_count": 500
    }
  }
}
```

## Verification Logic

### Like Verification
- Compares `like_count` before and after user action
- Success: Count increased by 1 or more
- High confidence: Exactly +1 increase
- Medium confidence: +2 or more (user may have liked other tweets)

### Retweet Verification
- Compares `tweet_count` for retweets (TwitterAPI.io limitation)
- Note: Direct retweet count not available in user metrics
- Alternative: Could track specific tweet retweet counts

### Reply Verification
- Compares `tweet_count` before and after user action
- Success: Count increased by 1 or more (new tweet/reply posted)

## API Health Check

Test if the service is working:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/twitterapi-io-proxy
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "twitterapi-io-proxy",
  "configured": true,
  "userId": "344176544479072260",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Testing User Lookup

Test fetching user data:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/twitterapi-io-proxy \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "twitter", "action": "getUserCounts"}'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "counts": {
    "tweets": 1234,
    "likes": 5678,
    "retweets": 0,
    "following": 100,
    "followers": 500
  },
  "username": "twitter",
  "userId": "783214",
  "service": "twitterapi.io"
}
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors
- **User not found**: Username doesn't exist or is private
- **Rate limit exceeded**: Too many requests (429 status)
- **API key invalid**: Credentials issue (401 status)
- **Service unavailable**: TwitterAPI.io service down (503 status)

### Rate Limits
TwitterAPI.io typically provides generous rate limits suitable for production use. Monitor the response headers for rate limit information.

## Security Features

### Built-in Security
- **Time Delays**: Minimum 10-second wait before verification
- **Handle Verification**: Must have valid Twitter handle
- **Session Management**: Verification sessions expire after 1 hour
- **Count Validation**: Actual count changes required (no manual bypass)

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
- Verification success rate
- API response times
- Rate limit usage
- Error rates by type

### Logging
The system logs:
- Verification attempts and results
- API calls and responses
- Error conditions and retries
- User actions and timing

## Advantages Over Previous Systems

### vs. Nitter
- ✅ **Always Available** - No service outages
- ✅ **Real-time Data** - No caching delays
- ✅ **Official API** - More reliable than scraping

### vs. Web Scraping
- ✅ **No Browser Required** - Lighter resource usage
- ✅ **Stable Interface** - No layout change issues
- ✅ **Higher Rate Limits** - Better for production

### vs. Twitter Official API
- ✅ **Pre-configured** - No setup required
- ✅ **Cost Effective** - Professional service at reasonable rates
- ✅ **Specialized** - Built for Twitter data access

## Production Considerations

### Scaling
- Monitor rate limit usage
- Implement request queuing if needed
- Consider multiple API keys for high volume

### Reliability
- Built-in retry logic (3 attempts)
- Graceful error handling
- Session persistence in localStorage

### Performance
- Fast API responses (typically <500ms)
- Efficient count comparison logic
- Minimal data transfer

This TwitterAPI.io integration provides a clean, reliable, and professional solution for Twitter verification without the complexity of multiple fallback systems.
